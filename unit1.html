						<h1>OpenCV Discourse Community</h1>
						<p>Our introduction to the course and to our first assignment consisted of a piece by educator and academic John Swales proposing the idea of a discourse community.  We looked at the piece in a way that would introduce many of the coming themes of the course, not only for information, which was directly relevant to our study of writing conventions, but also critically as a piece of writing.  We attempted to understand the writings materials, but also its characteristics as a piece of discourse produced at a particular time, for a particular audience.  This revelation informed the topic for the unit: understanding the audience and the context of a piece of writing.
						</p>

						<p>The task for this unit was focused on taking an outside perspective on a field that we were familiar with, and analyzing the conventions of it. I took an in depth look at the website for OpenCV, a library I have experience working with. Beyond the reintroduction to formal writing, my peer reviews helped to realize it’s easy to become accustomed to conventions of a discourse community require explanations for outsiders. It’s helpful to take a look back and understand what background knowledge aids in understanding a piece of writing.</p>
