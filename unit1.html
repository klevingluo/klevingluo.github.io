						<h1>OpenCV Discourse Community</h1>
						<p>	Unit 1 was focused on taking an outside perspective on a field that we were familiar with, and analyzing the conventions of it.  I took an in depth look at the website for OpenCV, a library I have experience working with.  Beyond the reintroduction to formal writing, my peer reviews helped to realize it’s easy to become accustomed to conventions of a discourse community require explanations for outsiders.  It’s helpful to take a look back and understand what background knowledge helps you to understand a piece of writing.</p>
