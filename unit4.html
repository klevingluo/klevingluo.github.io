						<h1>Web Security Campaign</h1>
						<p>Unit 4 was centered around working with a group to produce a set of materials that could be used as part of a public awareness campaign.  The focus was on using highly readable language to create writing that would not exclude any part of the public on the basis of readability.</p>

<p>Our group produced a brochure and a website educating the public on web safety practices, as well as a brief accompanying pitch and audience analysis.  The website can be found <a href="www.safenet.iconoworks.com">here</a>, and the accompanying materials are below.</p>

<h3>Audience Analysis:</h3>

The goal of our campaign is to educate the general public regarding better internet safety practices. We want people to know what internet security is, why it is important, and things people can do to better practice good security practices. This includes things such as knowing what unsafe emails look like as well as knowing about applications that can improve security. We also want to dispel any myths or misunderstandings regarding internet security to prevent laziness regarding good practices that can prevent damage to computers and network security. 
We seek as our target audience to inform anyone purchasing a new computer or anti-virus software package, typically of older age and less educated regarding computer safety and practices. Because of this targeted audience, we also are targeting people who are literate, but are not concerned with any ethnicity, race, or gender. This would include anyone buying computers from a retail outlet, such as Best Buy, and persons using 3rd party installation services such as Geek Squad. 
We would develop agreements with retailers to provide either a physical copy when one of the the previous items is sold in a store or a digital one if the security software is downloaded. We would also create a website that restates the information in this pamphlet along with additional information for people to read through at their own leisure even if they do not purchase any hardware or software. People would be able to access basic information from the pamphlet and more in depth tips from our website. Like this, we can target both people who are just about to get access to the internet and to remind users of good practices.</p>

<h3>Pitch: </h3>

One of the major issues in general computer science today that is most prevalent is the idea of encryption and cyber security. Whether it’s the dispute between Apple and the FBI or Hillary Clinton’s Gmail account being hacked, the idea that your information online isn’t secure is a threat that is spreading through the minds of the public. Our public education campaign could be based around the idea of teaching other about the importance of cyber security and encryption in programs we use on a daily basis and devices we have on our persons 24/7. The general audience that we could be reaching for would be most likely a slightly older audience than the age of those in the classroom, as most people with our similar age are versed with technology, but generally the audience would be about everyone. One way we could allow access to the information would be through either a website, because it would be accessible by all those interested because all those interested have some form of digital internet-accessible device, or we could use some sort of flyer/poster to spread around with some of the most basic information, because if the idea of insecurity is on the mind of the audience, then seeing the information as they walk by would catch their eyes.</p>
