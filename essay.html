						<h1>Writing in College</h1>
						<p>It's been a while since I've taken a writing intensive course. The last time I had to write this much was during AP english my senior year of high school. I really feels like forever ago, and my writing skills are appropriately atrophied. The transition back into spending hours all night working on an essay was harsh at first. I don't remember ever enjoying taking a writing class, though I don't really mind this.</p>

<p>Since coming to college, it seems that writing has become more open in terms of creative options, even for essays and technical papers. I remember in high school, we had to follow a five paragraph structure very strictly. Now, it seems, what matters is not the structure of the writing, but how well it conveys the meaning that it intends to. Generally, I think I'm a lot more comfortable with this form of evaluation. Instead of a heavy focus on literature and writing as art, this course takes a very practical approach to writing, identifying very particular scenarios in which it can be used, and the best ways it can accomplish a goal.  Oddly when this is the goal, good writing takes on unfamiliar characteristics.  In our fourth assignment for this course, we were introduced to the Federal Clear Writing Standards, a guideline for producing documents for the general public.  Instead of emphasizing a varied vocabulary, this standard tried to make things understandable, encouraging use of words more widely understood.  One theme of the course was that the form of writing should be determined by its audience, purpose, and context.</p>

<p>As part of this goal, a major focus of the course was taking a very outside view of writing, not only considering the writing itself, but taking account of the context that surrounds it. Early on, we looked at the concept of discourse communities, and tried to apply it to some of the groups that we ourselves are members of. This kind of analysis provides insight into conventions and tropes common to the writing of a particular group. It has both the aspect of academic inquiry and the very practical consideration of becoming a better communicator within the field.</p>

<p>It does seem a little strange to me that writing in the technical professions in general can be grouped together to make a cohesive class. A lot necessary context wasn't shared between us, and some of our technical writing was incomprehensible to each other.  I recall trying in vain to understand one of my peer’s paper on Subcutaneous Injection CT Imaging, not knowing where to start, or if I should criticize it for being incomprehensible.  The kind of writing I’m doing in the class is, I imagine, not exactly the kind of writing I will be doing during my career, although I guess the skills, identifying the conventions of a particular discourse community, will invariably prove useful.  Working through these contexts will inevitably be a big part of any STEM career.</p>

<p>Definitely, my two biggest takeaways for this class are that the process of writing is really the process of rewriting, and that peer review is essential. The strategy I’ve found that works for tackling difficult writing projects best is simply to write, and to formulate and formally state a stance based on the direction the writing is going in later, once my ideas are more fully developed. Writing is really an organization of thoughts, and the order the thoughts come to me may not be the order that I want to present them to a reader</p>

<p>It’s very helpful to get practical, concrete advice from my fellow students and professor. I like when they point to specific parts of my writing, but include a tip that can be generalized to a broader scope. I learned that I have a tendency to use words that mean very little in the context of professional writing, such as very, and various. Things like this take up space, and don’t contribute to the meaning of a sentence.</p>

<p>As a result of working through the material and assignments of this course, I’ve come to a better understanding of myself as a writer. I am a member of a specific community, and I need to know the particular conventions of it.  In order to succeed in my career, I need a working knowledge of how memos, code, reviews and documentation is written.  This alone is not enough however, I also need to know how to transmit this information to other people, knowing the basics of writing in other fields and the general population.  Inevitably, I will need to play the seemingly contradictory roles of enforcer, challenger, and ambassador to the common habits of  writing in my field.</p>
