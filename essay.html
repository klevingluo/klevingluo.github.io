						<h1>Writing in College</h1>
						<p>It's been awhile since I've taken a writing intensive course. The last time I had to write this much was during AP english my senior year of high school. I really feels like forever ago. I guess the transition back into writing was a little rough. I don't remember ever enjoying taking a writing class, though I don't really mind this one I guess.</p>
 
  <p>Since coming to college, it seems that writing has become more open in terms of creative options, even for essays and technical papers. I remember in high school, we had to follow a five paragraph structure very strictly. Now, it seems, what matters is not the structure of the writing, but how well it conveys the meaning that it intends to. Generally, I think I'm a lot more comfortable with this form of evaluation.  Instead of a heavy focus on literature and writing as art, this course takes a very practical approach to writing, identifying very particular scenarios in which it can be used, and the best ways it can accomplish a goal.</p>
 
  <p>As part of this goal, a major focus of the course was taking a very outside view of writing, not only considering the writing itself, but taking account of the context that surrounds it.  Early on, we looked at the concept of discourse communities, and tried to apply it to some of the groups that we ourselves are members of.  This kind of analysis provides insight into conventions and tropes common to the writing of a particular group.  It has both the aspect of academic inquiry and the very practical consideration of becoming a better communicator within the field.</p>
  
  <p>It does seem a little strange to me that writing in the technical professions in general can be grouped together to make a cohesive class.  A lot necessary context wasn't shared between us, and some of our technical writing was incomprehensible to each other.  The kind of writing I’m doing in the class is, I imagine, not exactly the kind of writing I will be doing during my career, although I guess the skills, identifying the conventions of a particular discourse community, will invariably prove useful.</p>

<p>Definitely, my two biggest takeaways for this class are that the process of writing is really the process of rewriting, and that peer review is essential.  The strategy I’ve found that works for tackling difficult writing projects best is simply to write, and to formulate and formally state a stance based on the direction the writing is going in later, once my ideas are more fully developed.  Writing is really an organization of thoughts, and the order the thoughts come to me may not be the order that I want to present them to a reader</p>

<p>It’s very helpful to get practical, concrete advice from my fellow students and professor.  I like when they point to specific parts of my writing, but include a tip that can be generalized to a broader scope.  I learned that I have a tendency to use words that mean very little in the context of professional writing, such as very, and various.  Things like this take up space, and don’t contribute to the meaning of a sentence.</p>
