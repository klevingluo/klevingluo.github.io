						<h1>Python List Comprehensions</h1>
						<p>Unit 3 was to produce a memo that would be sent to the coworkers in a workplace setting.  I decided to make a style guideline instructing my coworkers on how to use a python structure to make their code more easily readable.</p>
<p>I was a lot more comfortable with writing unit 3 than I was with Units 1 or 2. I think since unit 3 was focused towards an audience that I could assume had a certain level of knowledge, I could write more freely. It's important to be able to communicate with others within a field, but I feel like that is probably the easier task. Far more difficult is communicating with those who do not have the same type of specialized knowledge that some of us have, which is something I think Unit 4 is designed to tackle.</p>
  <p>I really liked writing the code samples, and I think that's actually a pretty important part of communicating in the field, writing code that is legible and easy to understand and reuse. Although, that clearly requires a broader definition of writing.</p>
