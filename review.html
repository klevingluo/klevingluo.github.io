						<h1>Peer Reviewing</h1>
						<p>One of the most important aspects of this course was the peer review aspect:  Reading each other’s work allowed us students to put our own work into context, as well as offer a helpful outside perspective on our writing.  I’ve included Ian Greenbaum’s peer review of my Unit 1 essay below.  I found it really helpful in identifying parts of my writing that were particularly difficult to understand, and some noticeable habits in my writing that limited its effectiveness.
