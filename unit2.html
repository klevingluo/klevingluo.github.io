						<h1>Facial Landmarking Developments</h1>
						<p>Unit 2 was a more traditional research paper, in which we presented an argument, and defended it with academic sources.</p>

						<p>We were to use all of our available skills to produce a piece of writing that would fit best in the current discourse that was happening in the field of our choice.  Although this assignment is similar in  structure to a typical high school english assignment, I found it very different than what I had done then.  The experience of arguing the themes of a novel are very little applicable to making an argument in the field.  Conventions like general statements and comparisons to the human condition are forgone for a more direct approach based in evidence and figures.</p>

						<p>I chose an ambitious topic that I had some limited familiarity with: facial landmarking, but I accomplished most of my goals with the piece below.</p>
