						<h1>Advanced Writing in the Tech Professions</h1>
						<p> I’m Kevin Luo and as of Spring 2016, I’m a Computer Science and Math combined major at Northeastern University in Boston.  I recently completed Advanced Writing in the Technical Professions with Prof. Ethan Whittet, a writing intensive course focused on producing the kind of written work required for a career in a STEM field. On this website, I’ve placed all my work for the class, as well as my thoughts on how it has helped me to develop as a writer. </p>
