						<h1>Advanced Writing in the Tech Professions</h1>
						<p>
						Hi, I’m Kevin Luo, and as of Spring 2016, I’m a Computer Science and Math combined major at Northeastern University in Boston. I recently completed <i>Advanced Writing in the Technical Professions</i> with Prof. Ethan Whittet, a writing intensive course focused on learning the conventions of discourse within various STEM fields. On this website, I’ve placed my work from the semester, as well as my thoughts on how the class has helped me to develop as a writer.
